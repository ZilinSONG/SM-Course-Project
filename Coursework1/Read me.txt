For this program,  it monitors Create.csv, Mode.csv, Delete.csv and ChangeState.csv four files. When the content of these file changed, the program will load and read the changed file 
and act accordingly. When there is no changed, the program will keep monitoring. To better see what happen when these file changed, I write some codes to make the program load 
and read these file directly and see the output.
To run this program, first enter javac *.java to complie all the code files in the directory of the code file and then enter java FileMonitor to see the output in the console.
You can also import the code files into the eclipse to run this program.
After running the program, if you don't it keep running, enter ctrl+c to end the program.
You will see the output of Create.csv, Mode.csv and ChangeState.csv. When load and read Delete.csv file, there is no output as the associated code has no output statement
